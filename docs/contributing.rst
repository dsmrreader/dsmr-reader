Feedback
--------
All feedback and any input is, as always, very much appreciated! 
It doesn't matter whether you run into problems getting started in this guide or just want to get in touch, just fire away!

.. seealso::
    
    `Please create an issue on Github <https://github.com/dennissiemensma/dsmr-reader/issues/new>`_ to get in contact.


Pull requests
-------------
Pull requests are appreciated, but please note that you should discuss any changes with a Github ticket first. 
It would be a shame if you'd put any effort in something that won't get merged after all.

Also, please do not create pull requests for the ``master`` branch, but always point it to ``development``.
